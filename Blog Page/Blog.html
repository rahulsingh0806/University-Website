                <p class="article-3-p3">With the COVID-19 pandemic, established systems like education, health, manufacturing, etc. have been severely impacted. According to the World Economic Forum, more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries have been affected by school closures due to the pandemic. This impelled educational institutions to adopt online technologies at a break-neck speed. This change has provided a clear picture of existing inequalities and a clearer picture of what steps we need to take in the future, chief among them addressing the education of students whose learning has been hampered due to school closures. It is evident that we cannot return to the world as it existed before the pandemic. One of the strongest messages is that our common humanity necessitates global solidarity.</p>
